# Introduction

It's my Neovim config, configured mainly for python
development. I've tried this config on Android with termux,
on Arch Linux, and on Windows 10. It works on any system
where you can install Neovim, nodejs, yarn and python.

Best graphics interface for Neovim in my opinion is builtin
[neovim-qt][1]
on windows and
[neovim-gtk][2] on Linux.

# Features

+ Autocompletion with [coc.nvim][3]
+ Go to definition with coc.nvim
